// Kind: TOY, built to illustrate the argument of Augustine, Confessions, Book XI, chs. XIII–XXIX (with Book X, chs.
// VIII–XI, on memory), in E. B. Pusey's translation (1838; CCEL edition, pp. 130–176). The book has no data and no model.
// It asks where a length of time is held, and answers by elimination: not in the thing (a voice is gone once it stops),
// not in the motion of bodies (the sun, a potter's wheel: we measure their motion, and their standing still, by time),
// not in the future or the past as such (they are not), but in the mind, in passing, as a stretching between what it
// expects and what it remembers; and (ch. XXIX) a mind so stretched is also torn. The game is eleven measurements,
// each one a step of that argument, made with nothing but the player's mind: a moment of joy no clock ever measured; a
// voice held after it is gone; last night and yesterday, which only a clock measured, rendered as a relation of two
// sounds; nothing, listened for three times and then guessed at, which is the trap; a voice in the middle between two
// others, and half of one, from the present; a silence planned and then recognised among sounds; the sun's standing
// still, measured by a sound; three things from yesterday, and which was longest; a crowd; and the two inner spans
// recognised again at the end. Every length, pitch, pair and reading is ours; the book gives none.

      means: 'For Augustine, time is a stretching of the mind (his word is distentio), between what it expects and what it remembers. A life is the same shape as a psalm said by heart, or an evening like this: expected whole, then passing through attention into memory. And the stretching that lets a mind measure anything is the stretching that scatters it.',

      present: 'A hundred years can’t all be present: only one year of it is now, the rest is past or still to come. Nor can that year: only one month. Nor the month, nor the day, nor the hour. Look closer and closer, and nothing is left but a point. The present has no length. That point was the black circle you pressed all evening.',

      stranger: 'Had the game asked you for the half of a voice you had never heard, every release would have been as right as any other. You can expect only what you remember. That is why the night, which you never attended to, is in you only as a number a clock gave you, and the moment of joy, which nothing measured, is in you as a length.',
      builder: 'Augustine\u2019s problem is the economist\u2019s, because the thing economists most want to measure, how much better off a person is, is also measured in the mind, and the same ladder was climbed there, in the same order, fifteen hundred years later. First the claim that only an order can be known, better or worse, never by how much: that was Pareto\u2019s, and it is your three things. Then the claim that differences can be compared, that going from here to there can be known to be a bigger step than going from there to beyond: that gives equal steps, it was Lange\u2019s and Alt\u2019s, and it is your middles. Then gambles were found to pin the steps down, which was von Neumann\u2019s and Morgenstern\u2019s. And then the one thing nobody could supply: a zero, because no experience is a zero of experience, so \u201ctwice as well off\u201d never got a meaning. Time has what utility lacks. The present is its zero. Tonight you were handed that zero, you halved and doubled from it, and you found that against it, nothing can be counted.',
      torn: 'Augustine does not end here pleased with the clock he found. The same stretching of the mind that measures a voice is what scatters a life: in the next chapter he calls himself torn among times whose order he does not know, his thoughts mangled by tumultuous varieties, and asks to be gathered. The crowd you were in was his.',
