# Lovelace's Cards — design memo

## 0. Given

Mine: Steffen's signature and counter. Two ideas given, and binding. (1) *The Notes are the text; Menabrea's Sketch is scaffolding.* The game is built from Notes A to G: the separation of operations from the things operated on (A), the Store and the Variable-cards (B, D), the backing of the cards into cycles (C, E), three cards for three hundred and thirty (F), the Numbers of Bernoulli and "the Engine originates nothing" (G). Menabrea supplies the Engine's parts and his own small examples (the registering apparatus that counts a power down to zero, pp. 12–13; the bell) and nothing else. (2) *One of the three concepts may have the player write a small program for the Engine, if it can be made fun.* It is concept A, and it is the pick: the memo says below why it is fun and where the risk is. Neither idea overrides precedent; the precedent rule and the ideas pull the same way.

## 1. Paper

L. F. Menabrea, *Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage* (Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève, October 1842, No. 82), translated with Notes by the translator, Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace. *Scientific Memoirs* 3 (1843): 666–731. R. & J. E. Taylor, London. No DOI. Available: a 63-page re-typeset PDF of the 1843 publication (not a scan; text, tables and diagrams typeset; the Bernoulli diagram, Table A.2, is reproduced as an image), read in full: the Memoir (17 pp.), Notes A–G (42 pp.), the editor's preface. Online: the Fourmilab transcription, fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html; Wikisource. No code or data attached, and none exists; the Engine was never built. Page numbers below are the PDF's.

## 2. What the paper hands over

**Primary: a model**, ported. The Notes specify a machine precisely enough to run: a Store of columns of figure-wheels, each column a number with a sign (Note B, with its diagram); Operation-cards that put the mill into an adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing state, and Variable-cards that say which columns supply the mill and which receive the result (Note B, D); cards of numbers for constants (Memoir p. 15); a prism over which the chain of cards passes, which can be made to *revolve backwards* so that a card or set of cards does duty again, which is a cycle (Note C, E); a contingent course, where the Engine "feels" a value by a subtraction and follows one course or the other (Note G, Operation 7; Memoir p. 12); a bell at the end, and a bell on a passage through zero (Memoir p. 12). The Notes then write programs in this language: ax^n, a·n·x, a/n·x, a+n+x (B); the two linear equations in eleven operations with three operation cards (D); the trigonometric series (E); and the Numbers of Bernoulli, twenty-five operations with a cycle inside a cycle (G, Table A.2). The game ports the machine and runs those programs on it.

**Secondary: an argument.** Note A: the Analytical Engine is an *embodying of the science of operations*, the operations being "wholly independent" of the quantities they act on; a Difference Engine does one fixed thing (six additions, "6(+)"), the Analytical Engine does whatever the cards say. Note F: cycles and backing let three cards do the work of three hundred and thirty. Note G: the Engine "has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform"; and the counts: nine cards for the first Number of Bernoulli, fourteen for the second, twenty-five for the third and every one after, "however great n may be".

## 3. The discovery, and its kind

**A mechanism made intelligible**, with a counterintuitive edge. The intelligible mechanism: a card is an instruction; a column is a number; the two never mix, so the same cards serve for any numbers; and a card that turns the prism back makes a cycle. The edge, which is Lovelace's own in Notes C, F and G: a chain of cards you can count on one hand computes a table of any length and a Number of Bernoulli of any order, and adding more to n adds nothing to the cards. A stranger expects a bigger sum to need a bigger machine or more instructions; it needs neither. And underneath, Note G: all of it was ordered; none of it was thought of by the Engine.

## 4. The core narrative

There is a machine made of wheels that can add, take away, multiply and divide, but it does nothing at all until you hang cards over a drum, and then it does exactly what the cards say and nothing else. You want it to work out a sum for some numbers. You can hang a card for every step, and it works, but only for those numbers: hand it different ones and it gets the sum wrong, because the cards never knew the numbers. Or you can hang one card that says "turn the drum back and do those cards again until the counter is at nothing", and now a few cards do a sum of any size, and the same few cards do it for any numbers you give the machine. The machine never thinks of anything itself. Everything it ever did, you told it.

## 5. Who lives in the paper

- **The analyst who makes out the cards** (Lovelace's own seat; Note G's "we", Menabrea's "workman" who will be handed the formulae). Controls: which cards, in which order, over which columns; where to back the prism. Could be asked to anticipate: what the chain will do for numbers not yet seen.
- **The Engine itself** (the mill, the Store, the prism). Controls nothing; that is Note G's point. As a subject it would be a wordless real-time job.
- **The prism** that revolves forwards and backwards (Note C). Controls: when to go back, and how far. A one-control agent, the heart of the cycle.
- **The Variable-cards** (Note D's Supplying and Receiving cards; Retaining and Zero cards). Control: which column feeds the mill, and whether a value returns or is zeroed. The economy of Note D (three operation cards for eleven operations) lives here.
- **The attendant** who puts the Engine in action and is called by the bell (Memoir pp. 12, 15). Controls: data, and the restart after a passage through zero.
- **The reader Note G warns**, who overrates and then undervalues the Engine. A forecaster at best.

## 6. Precedent

| Game | Position | Format | Feedback device | Chassis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Noether's Press (noether) | the transformation (an agent: the player is the group, drawing the free function) | strategic, a contest with the Auditor | the stamped tag and the needle | night-shift machine hall (Techno): gunmetal, brushed steel, neon cyan, neon magenta, hazard yellow; Chakra Petch + Saira + Share Tech Mono; steel levers with a lit edge |
| Brown's Restless Dust (brown) | controller (sets the conditions of one drop, aims at stillness) | impossible challenge | the live drop and the shelf of suspects | hand-coloured natural-history plate, 1828 (Austere): plate cream, ink, Prussian blue, almond gold, carmine, bottle green; IM Fell English; labels with a double rule |
| Benjamin's Veil (benjamin) | agent (keeper of one work, a timing decision) | challenge: optimal stopping | the halo and the crowd | 1930s photomontage poster (Worldly): cream, ink, red, halftone grey, gold leaf; Oswald + Libre Franklin; red slabs with an ink rule |

**What this game does differently.**
- **Position: the analyst, with the paper's own instrument in hand.** The player sits where Lovelace sat: the Store in front of them, blank pasteboard beside them, and makes out the cards. Not a transformation, not a controller of a system's conditions, not a keeper with a timing decision: a builder whose construction is then tested by the machine on numbers the builder did not see. *I hung five cards and the bell rang for every n.*
- **Format: a construction challenge under a hidden test.** The player builds a chain, commits it, and the Engine runs it twice: once on the numbers shown, then on numbers it is handed afterwards. Noether's player contested an inspector; Brown's could not win; Benjamin's chose a moment. Here the player makes a thing, and the thing either holds or does not.
- **Device: the printed strip and the turning wheels (one of our own).** The Engine prints its results on a paper strip; the figure-wheels of the Store turn as the cards act; the prism visibly revolves backwards when a card sends it back. Nothing is stamped, no drop dances, no halo thins.
- **Chassis: the Engine's own apparatus, drawn from Lovelace's Note B diagram, on pasteboard** (Instrument family: a picture you act on; the last three were Techno, Austere and Worldly). Light after Noether's dark steel. Pasteboard buff, ink, Jacquard plum, verdigris, mahogany; Abril Fatface and Old Standard TT; buttons are punched cards. No neon, no watercolour wash, no red slab.

## 7. The aim and the verdict

**Aim** (start screen, top of play, first line of How to play): *Hang the cards that make the Engine print what is wanted, for any numbers it is handed.*

The yardstick during play is in the aim's units: the strip (what the Engine printed against what was wanted), the bell (it rang or it did not), and the number of cards on the chain. After each task: *The bell rang. Five cards. It held for n = 3 and for n = 1.*

**Verdict** (first lines of the end screen):
- What you did: *Every chain held.* (or *Two chains held; one you handed to the Countess.*) *Thirteen cards across three tasks: three for a·n·x, five for a·xⁿ, five for the table of squares. Each chain went on working when the Engine was handed numbers you had never seen.*
- What the paper says: *The cards carry the operations and the columns carry the numbers, and the two never mix: that is why one chain serves every n. A card that turns the prism back makes a cycle, and a cycle lets a handful of cards do the work of hundreds: three cards for three hundred and thirty in one of Lovelace's examples, twenty-five for every Number of Bernoulli there is, however great n may be.*
- What that means: *The Engine originates nothing. It did what you knew how to order it to do, and nothing else.*
- Coda, after the verdict: Lovelace's own chain for the Numbers of Bernoulli, run on this Engine in front of the player, printing 1/6, −1/30, 1/42, −1/30 on the strip; and her line about music.

## 8. Three concepts

**A. Lovelace's Cards — the analyst (pick).** Position: experimenter, the paper's own instrument in the player's hands. Format: construction challenge under a hidden test. Controls: a card composer (take a column, combine with a column, put on a column; print a column; turn the prism back k cards while a column is not nothing); hang, take down, set the Engine going. Deliberation: which columns, in what order, where to back the prism, and the question the task poses outright: will this hold when n changes? What they see after: the cards light one by one, the wheels turn, the strip prints, the bell rings or not; then the Engine is handed new numbers and runs the same chain again. Discovery moment: task two. The player hangs five multiplications and a print, the bell rings for n = 5, and the Engine is handed n = 3 and prints the same number again. The cards never knew n. Then they find the card that turns the prism back, and the chain shrinks and holds. Fun: agency (every card does something visible), anticipation (the hidden test), discovery (the cycle), mastery (task three's cycle is built in a minute). Second playthrough: shorter chains; the table with additions only, the player having used multiplications the first time; the Countess's chain run at the end.

**B. The Mill (reckless).** Position: subject; the player *is* the Engine. A wordless play screen: cards come down the chain in real time and the player, as the mill, must fetch the two columns each card names and deliver the result to the column it names, by tapping, before the next card arrives; the strip prints whatever they delivered. At the end the player is told they computed a Number of Bernoulli and asked what they decided along the way. Nothing: the discovery is Note G from inside. Deliberation: none, by design; it is a skill run. Fun: anticipation and mastery for a minute, then tedium; and the discovery is a feeling about one's own passivity, not a thing found out about the Engine. Walkthrough below. Not picked; what is kept from it is the coda, where the Engine runs the Countess's chain by itself and the player only watches.

**C. Three Cards for Three Hundred and Thirty.** Position: controller; the player is the attendant who arranges the order of the operations. Format: challenge, an ordering puzzle. Given a computation's operations with their dependencies (Note D's eleven, Note F's elimination), reorder them so that operations of the same nature fall together and the fewest operation cards are needed, without using a result before it exists; Note D's answer is three cards for eleven operations; Note F's is three for three hundred and thirty. Deliberation: real, a scheduling puzzle. Discovery: the separation of operation cards from variable cards, Note A's point, as an economy. Fun: mastery and discovery; little anticipation. Second playthrough: harder dependency graphs. A sound puzzle whose discovery is thinner for a stranger than A's, and which never lets the player build anything.

## 9. The first five minutes

**A, the pick.** 0:00 The title, a line of punched pasteboard across the top, a strip of paper hanging from a slot. "You will hang cards, set the Engine going, and listen for the bell." The aim. Begin. 0:20 TASK 1 OF 3 · a·n·x. Three columns of figure-wheels, marked a, n, x, reading 5, 7, 98, and a blank column R. A strip at the right says WANTED: 3430. Below, the composer: a blank card with a row of six punches: + − × ÷ PRINT BACK. "A card takes two columns, combines them, and puts the result on a column. Tap ×, then a, then n, then R." They do. The card's text assembles itself: *a × n → R*. HANG THE CARD. The card drops onto the chain with holes punched in it. They hang *R × x → R* and *PRINT R* the same way, faster. SET THE ENGINE GOING. 1:10 The first card lights plum; the wheels on R spin to 35; the second lights; R spins to 3430; the third; the strip prints 3430 under WANTED 3430; a bell. Grin. "Now the Engine is handed other numbers." The wheels reset to 3, 4, 10; the chain runs again; the strip prints 120; the bell again. "The bell rang. Three cards. It held." NEXT TASK. 1:40 TASK 2 OF 3 · a·xⁿ. Columns a = 3, x = 2, n = 5, a column holding 1, and R. WANTED: 96. "Then the Engine will be handed other n." They think: 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2. They hang *a × x → R*, then *R × x → R* four times, then PRINT. Six cards. Going. The wheels climb 6, 12, 24, 48, 96; the strip prints 96; the bell. 2:40 "The Engine is handed n = 3." The wheels reset, n reads 3; the chain runs; R climbs to 96 again; the strip prints 96 under WANTED 24; no bell. Frown. "It held for n = 5 and fell at n = 3." They look at the chain. The cards never touched n. They look at the composer's sixth punch: BACK. "Turn the prism back k cards while a column is not nothing." They take down three multiplications, hang *n − 1 → n* and *BACK 2 WHILE n*, and, after a moment, see that the first multiplication is one too many and change it to *a × 1 → R*. Five cards. Going. 3:50 The prism icon turns forwards, the wheels climb, the prism turns backwards with a visible arc, n counts down to nothing, the strip prints 96; the bell; n = 3, 24, the bell; n = 1, 6, the bell. "The bell rang. Five cards. It held for n = 3 and for n = 1." Under it, the Countess's way: "Seven multiplications, she counts, for n = 7; or a registering apparatus counting down to zero, as here." 4:20 TASK 3 OF 3 · THE TABLE OF SQUARES, additions only. A = 1, B = 3, C = 2, n = 6. WANTED: 1 4 9 16 25 36. The × and ÷ punches are filled in. They look at B and C and the names under them, *first difference*, *second difference*. PRINT A; *A + B → A*; *B + C → B*; *n − 1 → n*; *BACK 4 WHILE n*. Five cards, built in a minute. The strip prints 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36; the bell; n = 9: nine squares; the bell. 5:30 The verdict.

**C, the runner-up.** 0:00 The title. Begin. Eleven operation tiles in a column, each with a nature (×, −, ÷) and the columns it reads and writes. "Arrange them so the mill changes its state as seldom as possible." They drag; a counter at the top says STATE CHANGES: 6. They notice all the multiplications can go first. STATE CHANGES: 2. The bell. 1:30 A second problem, forty tiles. They drag for three minutes. The puzzle is sound and the player learns to look for independent operations, which is Note A's point; but nothing is built, nothing is printed, no number was ever unseen, and the stranger could not say afterwards what the Engine did.

**B, the reckless one.** 0:00 No words. A chain of cards scrolls down; the top card shows two column letters and a third; the player taps those columns in the Store, a result appears, they tap the third. The next card. Faster. 0:40 They are good at it. 1:30 They are bored, and they have no idea what the numbers are. 3:00 The strip prints 1/6, −1/30, 1/42, −1/30 and a line says: you have computed the first four Numbers of Bernoulli; what did you decide? The point is made and it stings a little; but it is one point, made once, and nothing in the three minutes before it asked for a thought.

## 10. The pick, and why

**A.** The player is inside the paper at the one place the paper puts a free hand: the making out of the cards, which the Memoir says is where "the whole intellectual labour" will lie once the Engine exists. Every card does something the player can see (a wheel turns, a line prints), the deliberation is real (which columns, what order, where to back the prism), the commitment is real (the chain is hung before the Engine runs, and the test numbers are not shown), and the discovery lands inside the play, on a chain the player built and expected to hold. The second idea given asked whether writing a program could be made fun; the answer is yes when the program is three to five cards, the machine is visible, and the question is not "is it right?" but "will it hold when n changes?", which turns a correctness check into a bet. The author test: Lovelace would recognise her Note B examples run with her own data (a = 5, n = 7, x = 98), Menabrea's registering apparatus, her backing of the prism, Operation 7's feel for n, and her counts; she would enjoy watching a player hang six multiplications with confidence; and the coda runs her own table in front of her.

**The risk.** A card composer on a phone can be fiddly, and a stranger who cannot make the first card leaves. Mitigations: four taps per card, each tap named by a line under the Store; task one is a tutorial by shape (three cards, the first one spelt out in the orientation); the rack holds ten cards, so chains stay short; a hung card is taken down with one tap; and after two runs on a task the player may hand it to the Countess and see her chain instead.

**Runner-up: C.** Switch if the author wants Note D's economy (three operation cards for eleven operations) rather than Note C and G's cycle; it would be a sorting puzzle, and the Engine would not run in front of the player.

**What the reckless concept would have given.** B's experience of being the mill, wordless, in real time, and the sting of Note G felt rather than read. Kept from it: the coda, where the Engine runs the Countess's chain unaided and the player watches. Given up: the silence and the real time.

## 11. The shape

Three tasks, each one long round (build, run, test, retry until it holds or is handed over), then the verdict and the coda. Screens: start, play (one screen per task, same layout), the task verdict inside the play screen, end, how to play, about. No seed: the data are the paper's and fixed; the hidden tests are fixed too (their values are in the config block).

The tasks are the paper's own examples, ordered for the player:
1. **a · n · x** (Note B, p. 31: "(×, ×) or 2(×)", with Note B's data a = 5, n = 7, x = 98). The tutorial: three cards; the hidden test cannot fail a correct chain. The point: a card is an operation on columns.
2. **a · xⁿ** (Note B, p. 30: "seven multiplications" for n = 7; Memoir pp. 12–13: a registering apparatus counts n down and "the same processes are continually repeated until it only marks zero"; Note C: the prism revolves backwards). Data a = 3, x = 2, n = 5 (ours, to keep the wheels readable); hidden tests n = 3 and n = 1. The discovery.
3. **The table of squares** (Memoir p. 3, Table 1.1; Note A: the Difference Engine is "6(+)"; p. 24: "The table of squares can be calculated to any extent whatever, when the numbers one and two are furnished"). Additions and subtractions only. Data: the square 1, the first difference 3, the second difference 2, n = 6; hidden test n = 9. Mastery, and the second half of Note A: the Analytical Engine does what the Difference Engine did, with five cards.

Score: the card count per task and whether the chain held; the verdict in words. The card count is the paper's own yardstick (Notes D, F, G count cards), not ours. The rack of ten and the three tasks are ours.

## 12. Controls, mechanism, feedback, moment

**Controls.** A composer with six punches: + − × ÷ PRINT BACK. For an operation: tap the punch, then a column to take from, a column to combine with, a column to put the result on (the Store's columns are the buttons). For PRINT: a column. For BACK: how many cards (1–8) and the column to test ("while it is not nothing"). HANG THE CARD. Tap a hung card to take it down. SET THE ENGINE GOING. After a run: NEXT TASK when it held; otherwise edit and go again; HAND IT TO THE COUNTESS after two runs.

**Mechanism** (`mechanism.js`, ported). A Store of columns holding signed numbers; a chain of cards; an interpreter that executes cards in order, writing results to columns, printing to a strip, and on a BACK card re-presenting the card k places earlier if the tested column is not zero (Lovelace's backing; Menabrea's contingent course). A step cap stands in for an attendant who stops an Engine that runs on; a division by zero rings the bell early (Memoir p. 12). A task is passed when the strip equals the wanted strip for the given data and for every hidden test. The same interpreter runs the Countess's Bernoulli operations in the coda and in the calibration check.

**Feedback.** The card in action lights plum and the prism turns; the receiving column's wheels turn to the new figure; PRINT adds a line to the strip beside the WANTED strip; BACK draws the prism turning backwards and an arc up the chain; the bell (a plum BELL stamp and a short chime drawn, not played) or NO BELL with the reason in one line.

**Moment.** Task two, second run: the strip prints 96 under WANTED 24, and the line says "It held for n = 5 and fell at n = 3." The player's eye goes to the chain and sees that no card touches n.

## 13. The look

**Register: the Engine's own apparatus, drawn from Lovelace's Note B diagram, on pasteboard** (Instrument family: a picture you act on). It comes from the paper's subject, which has a picture in it: the Store as Lovelace draws it, V₁ V₂ V₃ … with a sign circle above, tiers of figures, and a square beneath for the symbol; the Jacquard cards of pasteboard with holes, hung over the prism; a printing apparatus that prints the results on a strip. Light ground after Noether's dark steel.

- **Palette:** pasteboard buff `#EDE2C4` (the ground, the cards); ink `#1E1A17` (text, rules, the figures on the wheels); Jacquard plum `#8B2252` (the card in action, the bell, the punches chosen); verdigris `#2E7D6B` (a chain that held, the strip's matching lines, NEXT); mahogany `#6B3A22` (the prism, the frame of the Store, the strip's slot). Nothing else; no gold, no blue, no neon.
- **Type:** Abril Fatface (SIL OFL), a fat-face display from the 1840s playbill tradition, for the title, the task bands, the bell; Old Standard TT (SIL OFL), the face of nineteenth-century scientific memoirs, regular and italic, for text, the figures on the wheels and the strip. Embedded as data.
- **Buttons:** punched cards: a buff pasteboard rectangle, 1 px ink edge, a row of punched holes along its top edge (ink dots), text in Old Standard small capitals; the chosen punch is a plum hole; the primary action (SET THE ENGINE GOING, BEGIN, NEXT TASK) is a card with a plum stripe down its left edge. No radius, no offset shadow.
- **The one visual rule:** cards are the only things with holes, and wheels are the only things that turn. Every instruction on the screen is a punched card, with its holes punched in a pattern that encodes the card; every number is a column of figure-wheels or a line on the strip; and the only colour that moves is plum, on the card the prism is presenting.
- **Play screen at 380 px:** the aim (two lines, 16 px) with ? at the right; the task band in Abril Fatface ("TASK 2 OF 3 · a · xⁿ") and one line of what is wanted and that other numbers will follow; the Store, five columns of six figure-wheels each with the sign circle and the name square, 290 px wide and about 180 px tall, inside a mahogany frame (answers "what numbers does the Engine hold?"); the strip beside it, 70 px wide, WANTED printed faint and the Engine's lines printed in ink as they come (answers "did it print what was wanted?"); the chain, hung cards one under another, 44 px each, with the prism drawn at the left and the back-arcs drawn in the margin (answers "what have I told it to do?"); the composer, a blank card being punched, with the six punches in a row and the card's text assembling (answers "what am I about to hang?"); SET THE ENGINE GOING.

## 14. What is cut

The separation of Operation-cards from Variable-cards (a card here says both the operation and the columns; Note D's three operation cards for eleven operations is quoted on the About screen, not played); the Retaining and Zero Supply-cards (every column keeps its value); the cards of numbers (constants are inscribed on columns at the start, "by hand merely", as Note B says); the sign discs' arithmetic (signs are carried by the numbers); the forty-digit columns (six figure-wheels are drawn; the mechanism is not limited); the trigonometric series of Note E; the symbolic results of Notes A and B; the whole of Note F's elimination (quoted); the Bernoulli numbers as a task (run as a coda); the indexed column that Operation 21 steps forward on each repetition (the coda's cycle is written out).

## 15. Divergences

- **Merged cards.** One card carries the operation and its columns. Reason: three taps instead of six per step, and the economy of Note D is not this game's discovery. Declared on the About screen.
- **One contingent card.** BACK k WHILE a column is not nothing. Lovelace's backing (Note C) and her Operation 7 (a subtraction, then one course or the other) combined into one card; the Memoir's forward contingent cards are not offered. Reason: one card kind for the stranger; every cycle in the Notes can be written with it when the body is harmless on an extra pass.
- **Our data for tasks two and three** (a = 3, x = 2, n = 5; the squares to six) so that the wheels stay readable; task one uses Note B's own 5, 7, 98.
- **A rack of ten cards** and a step cap of four hundred. Lovelace says there is no limit to the number of cards; the rack fits a phone and the cap stands in for the attendant.
- **The sign in Operation 24** of the coda: the chain subtracts V13 from the result column so that the strip prints the signed Number formula (8) gives (B₁ = 1/6, B₃ = −1/30); Lovelace's table adds, and says it disregards signs. **Operation 4** divides V4 by V5, as her text's result column (2n−1)/(2n+1) requires, not V5 by V4 as the table's symbol column misprints.
- **The coda's cycle written out.** Operations 13–23 are hung twice for n = 4 because this Engine's cards cannot step a column forward on each pass (Lovelace's Operation 21 does); the card count 9 / 14 / 25 is checked on the unrolled chains for n = 1, 2, 3, where no repetition occurs.

## 16. Mechanism kind and claim boundaries

**Ported.** `mechanism.js` is an interpreter for the card language of the Memoir and the Notes: a Store of columns holding signed numbers; cards that put the mill into one of its four states and name the columns that supply it and receive from it; a card that turns the prism back k cards while a tested column is not zero (Note C's backing joined to Note G's Operation 7); a print to the strip; a bell at the end; an early bell on a division by zero (Memoir p. 12); a step cap standing in for the attendant. The same interpreter runs the three tasks, the heuristics, Note B's examples, Menabrea's Table 1.3, Note D's eleven operations, Table 1.1's differences, and the Countess's Bernoulli chain in the coda.

- **The game demonstrates** that the Notes' card language, run, computes the Notes' own examples; that a chain naming columns holds under new data where a chain of fixed repetitions does not; that a cycle makes the card count independent of n; and that formula (8), executed as her table orders it, yields her four Numbers.
- **It assumes** merged cards (operation and columns on one card), one backward contingent card, constants inscribed on columns, a rack of ten, a cap of four hundred steps, our data for tasks two and three, and the hidden tests; and in the coda the corrected division order of Operation 4, a subtracting Operation 24, and the unrolled cycle for n = 4.
- **The paper establishes** the design of the Engine and its claims about what it could do, not that it did it (it was never built). Nothing in the game is evidence about the machine; it is the Notes' language running.

**Where the discovery comes from.** The task-two discovery (the straight chain fails under new n, the cycle holds) follows from the mechanism, not from a scoring rule: the hidden test is our choice, but any test with n ≠ the given n produces it (ROB check: 53 random cases). The card count is the Notes' own yardstick (Notes D, F, G). The rack of ten is ours and binds nothing in the walkthrough (the longest sensible chain is six).

## 17. Calibration plan and result

Checks in `calibration.js`, each against the paper's own text: (B) Note B's four examples with her data; (M) Menabrea's registering apparatus for n = 1..8, cycle count constant at five against n + 1 straight; (T1) Table 1.1; (T3) Table 1.3 on random data against the closed form; (D) Note D's eleven operations on random data against the solution of the two equations; (C) backing re-presents cards and a counter that never returns to zero runs on; (Z) the early bell; (G) the Bernoulli chain prints 1/6, −1/30, 1/42, −1/30 each from the ones before, with 9, 14, 25, 25 operation cards, and formula (8) with the A's of the text agrees; (F) the 330; (TK) the tasks' reference chains and the heuristics; (ROB) the discovery under random data; (W) no decimals in anything the screen reads from the mechanism.

**Result: 29 passed, 0 failed** (`calibration-result.txt`).

**Heuristics, task two (a·xⁿ, given n = 5; tests n = 3, n = 1):**

| chain | cards | given | n = 3 | n = 1 | held |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| straight (six multiplications) | 6 | bell | wrong (prints 96) | — | no |
| cycle, counter off by one | 6 | bell | bell | runs on | no |
| cycle with the counter right | 5 | bell | bell | bell | yes |

The spread is real: the obvious chain passes the visible test and fails the hidden one; the first cycle a player builds often fails at n = 1, which is the case Lovelace's Operation 7 exists for; the right cycle is the shortest. Task three: five cards of additions; a multiplicative chain is barred by the task (Note A).

## 18. Build log

1. Mechanism in `mechanism.js`; calibration 29/29 on the first full run after one guard fix (a run with no wanted strip).
2. `loop.js` on placeholder graphics: three cards, the straight chain falling at n = 3, the cycle holding, the table; the result line says what was printed and what was wanted.
3. Skin per §13: pasteboard, ink, plum, verdigris, mahogany; Abril Fatface and Old Standard TT embedded; punched-card buttons; the Store from Note B's diagram with rolling figure-wheels; the strip; the prism marker and back-arcs. First screenshots showed the figure-wheels unclipped (inline tiers) and a horizontal overflow at five columns; fixed by block tiers and 46 px columns. The bell moved to the strip's foot so it covers no printed line.
4. Text: aim on the start screen, its own line, after the two physical acts (punch, hang, set going, listen); orientation on each task; button words defined on the screen; no decimals; verdict in words; About with the three claim lines.
5. Self-review from the screenshots: the aim can be stated from the start screen alone; the discovery from the top of the end screen ("Every chain held … the two never mix … The Engine originates nothing"); it looks like no game in the table (light pasteboard after dark steel; no stamp, no plate, no poster).
6. `session-test.js`: two full sessions at 380 px in headless Chromium (held everywhere; handed task two over), help opened mid-task and returned with the chain kept, the coda run, About; no console errors, no horizontal scroll. Session length is an estimate (about six minutes) until a person has measured it.

## 19. Revision: the on-ramp (1 Nov 2026)

**Given.** Steffen, after playing: *lovely overall, but it needs more explanation; I feel completely overwhelmed. Try harder to make this accessible, ideally also for a very smart eight-year-old.* This binds, and it overrides the skill's rule that orientation does not say the procedure, for job one only (see below).

**Diagnosis.** The first version asked the player to plan in an unfamiliar language before seeing a single card work. The Store, the composer's six punches, algebraic task names (a·xⁿ) and the strip all arrived at once, and the BACK card had to be understood from a line of help text.

**What changed** (the mechanism's rules did not):
- **A tour before job one**, played one step per tap: Note B's a × n with a = 5, n = 7 on two cards, each step narrated ("Card 1: a × n is 5 × 7 = 35. It goes on R."), closing on the point of Note A: the cards said "a" and "n", not "5" and "7". Skippable; replayable from How to play.
- **A countdown that shows the BACK card**: PRINT k, k − 1 → k, BACK 2 WHILE k ≠ 0, with k = 3, stepped and narrated, printing 3 2 1. Available from jobs two and three and from How to play, always, not on a stall: it teaches the card, not the job.
- **Every card is a sentence.** The card being punched shows "This card says: Multiply a by n, and put the answer on R."; every hung card carries its sentence under its symbols.
- **The Engine narrates while it runs**, card by card, with the numbers ("Card 3: n is 4, not 0, so the prism turns back 2 cards."), slowly for the first ten steps; and the run's verdict is repeated in that box beside the Engine.
- **Jobs in words.** "Three numbers multiplied", "Doubling" (start with 3 and double it 5 times; then a different number of doublings), "The square numbers" (1, 4, 9, 16 … with the odd-number trick from Table 1.1 shown as a worked line). Each job shows its sum worked out with the numbers given. Columns carry plain tips under their names (answer, how often, just 1).
- **Job one is coached**: tap ×, then a, n and R; after the first card, "now multiply in x, then print R". This is the override: the first job teaches the hands, and gives away its answer. Jobs two and three are not coached.
- **The fall explains itself**: when a chain fails a hidden test and no card ever read the changed column, the line adds "No card ever used n, so the cards did exactly what they did before." This is the discovery said in words after the player has committed and seen the consequence; it describes the chain, and it does not say what to build.
- **Handing a job to the Countess hangs her cards and runs them**, instead of only quoting her; her three chains are in the config block and checked.
- **The verdict leads with a plain line** ("A few cards can do a big job, for any numbers, if one of them says 'go back and do that again'. And the Engine only ever does what the cards tell it.") before the paper's version. Five figure-wheels instead of six; leading zeros faint.

**Checks.** Calibration 33/33: the earlier 29 plus the Countess's chains holding on every job, the tour printing 35, the countdown printing 3 2 1 and passing BACK at 0, and no decimals in any narration or card sentence. Browser session at 380 px through the tour, the countdown mid-job, help and back, both sessions including the hand-over; no errors, no horizontal scroll. Estimated length now about eight minutes. Still builder's review only: whether an eight-year-old gets through job two is the open question, and it needs a child.

## 20. Fix: taps on a phone (1 Nov 2026)

Steffen, on a phone: *I can't choose much in the first screen; whatever I do, it takes just the first option.* Not reproducible in Chromium's iPhone and Pixel emulation, and no WebKit was available to test Safari itself. Two causes in the code fit the report, and both are fixed:
- **Double-tap zoom.** On iOS Safari two quick taps on a page that allows zooming are read as a zoom gesture, and the second tap is dropped; tapping a, n and R in quick succession could register only a. All buttons and the page now carry `touch-action: manipulation`.
- **No way to choose a slot.** Once a card's three columns were filled, the next column tap always restarted at the first slot. The card being punched now shows three tappable slots (1st, 2nd, ans); the highlighted one is filled by the next column tap, and tapping a slot selects it for change. Switching the sign keeps the columns. A column tapped before any sign now says to tap a sign first, instead of doing nothing.

## 21. Fix: three numbers need two cards (1 Nov 2026)

Steffen, at job one: *I'm lost; I can only ever multiply two numbers.* The game never showed the step job one depends on: a card takes two numbers, so a × n × x needs two cards, and the second card reads the first card's answer from R. The tour multiplied two numbers and printed, which is exactly the move that does not generalise. Now:
- **The tour has three cards**: a + n → R (12), R + a → R (17), PRINT R. Its intro says a card can only use two numbers; its close says card 2 used R, card 1's answer, and that this is how the Engine does a long sum.
- **Job one's worked line** reads "5 × 7 = 35, then 35 × 98 = 3430. Two multiplications, so two cards, and a third card to print."
- **Job one's coaching** names the second card after the first is hung: tap ×, then R, then x, then R again, with what it does; then the print card.
Calibration 33/33 (the tour check now expects 17).
