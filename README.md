# paper-to-game

Send me a paper; you get back a playable browser game built from it.

The game is a beta: one self-contained HTML file, playable on a phone, with every number it uses sitting in a commented config block at the top of the source, tagged with the table, figure or equation it came from. You tweak it from there. The paper stays the authority wherever the two disagree.

How it works is in two documents. [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) finds the game: a design memo first (what the paper hands over, who lives in it, where the player sits, what the last games did and how this one differs, what it looks like). [`build.md`](build.md) builds it: the mechanism in one file, a headless check that it is calibrated to the paper's reported numbers, the claim boundaries, and the commit.

## Folder convention

One folder per paper, slugged: `olive/`. Inside: the game (`the-olive.html`), `memo.md`, `author-note.md`, the headless mechanism and its fidelity check, and the screenshots from the build. `inbox/` is where incoming PDFs go before a build.
