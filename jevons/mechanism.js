// had to choose something Jevons does not give, the line says "our choice".

// Revision 2: one production engine underneath. Power = coal x what a ton does; income = people x (power per
// head)^ALPHA; fuel's share of income, shown as days of a year's earnings, is the price; works go where power is
// cheap; an engine is fitted when the fuel it saves is worth its cost; the people's increase follows income per head.
// Revision 3: the player sets all ten generations; income per head is told per head of the people Britain would have
// had at the census rate (the gone counted in); a box for after 2065 values the coal left; and a score: the typical
// generation (the geometric mean of income per head over the ten and the box after) against the best path found.
